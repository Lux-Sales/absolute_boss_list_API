API made in Django, that allow add a user in a list of a boss in the game Tibia. The most part of the bosses in tibia, need 10-15 players to do it, and the website list was made to organizate it.

Anyone could add a player in the list, but only admin's could change the boss, clear the list, or change the admin's code.

Functions that i've made:
Add player, clear the entire list, change the admin's code, change the boss.

I've ended the project because my teammates had decided even tought the site was interesting, whatsapp group's was better for what we want.
